/*

Implement the following function, FindSortedArrayRotation, which takes as its
input an array of unique integers that has been sorted in ascending order, then
rotated by an unknown amount X where 0 <= X <= (arrayLength - 1). An array
rotation by amount X moves every element array[i] to array[(i + X) %
arrayLength]. FindSortedArrayRotation discovers and returns X by examining the
array.
